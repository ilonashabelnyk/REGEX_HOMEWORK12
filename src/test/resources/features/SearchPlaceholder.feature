  Feature: As a customer I want to provide a meaningful placeholder for search input field so that users can use search feature more efficiently

    @test
    Scenario: Validation of search input field placeholder
      Given Bookdepository website is opened on the main page
      When search input field is found
      When input field is found
      Then there is placeholder "Search for books by keyword / title / author / ISBN"
